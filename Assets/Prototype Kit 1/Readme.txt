This is a model and texture pack including 42 prefabs and 24 example rooms. The prefabs can be recolored using the pre-made textures, or by multiplying with a color in the material.

All models adhere to the Unity grid for easy positioning, and can be assembled either by using vertex snapping or any of the numerous third-party grid layout tools on the Asset Store.

The names of the prefabs are examples - naturally, any of these assets can be repurposed to fit the specific mechanics or needs of your game prototype.
