# Introduction
A game where controls a stone to 'roll' as move from start to end

# Gameplay
A puzzle game where the player must roll over a 2x1 brick to an exit point on the map. The brick cannot be moved off the edge of the board, and since it can only be flipped end over end and not slid around, the 2x1 nature restricts the types of moves it can make.
